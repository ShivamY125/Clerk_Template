This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel


Clerk Middleware:- docs:- https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware

Protection of Middleware means User need to signIn before addressing to those routes.



if we are going with protect all routes:- 

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])

// Here we will add all the routes which we need to be in public.   we can access those routes without even login or signin .

// There is also a isProtected Routes which is like only routes in this will only be protected.

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])
